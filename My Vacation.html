            <p>Summer of 2016 was the first trip I took out of the country. I went with a group of friends to the Dominican Republic and it was a vacation to remember. I was able to go zip lining, kayaking,swim with sharks, and go clubbing inside a cave. Going through this experience has created a desire for me to continue to save money and travel the world. I hope to save enough money every year to be able to afford to leave the country every summer and discover a new culture. </p>
